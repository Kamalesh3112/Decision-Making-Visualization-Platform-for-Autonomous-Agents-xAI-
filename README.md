# Decision-Making Visualization Platform for Autonomous Agents (xAI)

Welcome to the **Decision-Making Visualization Platform for Autonomous Agents (xAI)**!  
This project provides an interactive and intuitive platform for visualizing and understanding the decision-making processes of autonomous agents using explainable AI (xAI) techniques.

---

## üöÄ Overview

- **Purpose:**  
  Gain deep insights into how autonomous agents make decisions by visualizing their thought processes and justifications.
- **Visualization:**  
  Interactive dashboards and visual components make the black-box nature of AI models transparent and accessible.
- **Explainability:**  
  Designed to help researchers, students, and practitioners demystify agent behaviors.

## üèóÔ∏è Features

- **Agent Decision Path Visualization**
- **Customizable Scenarios & Inputs**
- **Rich, Interactive xAI Visuals**
- **Jupyter/Colab Notebook Integration**
- **Runs as a Streamlit App (Colab Compatible Only)**

## ‚ö° Quick Start (Google Colab Only)

> **Note:**  
> This project is intended to be run inside **Google Colab**.  
> It is *not* compatible with local Jupyter or other environments.

1. **Open the [Colab Notebook](./path/to/notebook.ipynb) in Google Colab.**
2. **Run all cells** to install dependencies, set up the environment, and launch the visualization server.
3. Once you see the message:
    ```
    Your app is running at http://localhost:8501
    ```
    Replace `localhost` with your current Colab VM's IP address, or use the provided external URL (if using ngrok):

    - **Colab IP Example:**  
      ```
      http://<your-colab-vm-ip>:8501
      ```
    - **ngrok Example:**  
      ```
      https://bd3eab6dcb0c.ngrok-free.app/
      ```

    > **Tip:** The notebook will usually print the external URL for you once the app is running.

4. **Click the generated link** to access your interactive visualization dashboard in a new browser tab.
